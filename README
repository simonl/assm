Learning x86 assembly language by writing a compiler. (10/2010)

"Compiler Compiler" written in Python for a few structured languages, generates x86 assembly language.
Syntax parsing rules are read from "/compiler/*.lex" and "/compiler/*.par" files.

Example:

program		:= <statement>

statement	:= <block> | <assignment>

block		= !"{" <statement>* !"}"
assignment	= variable !"=" <expression> !";"

expression	:= <functioncall> | <functiondef> | variable
functioncall	= <expression> !"(" <expression>* !")"
functiondef	= !"(" variable* !")" <block>
